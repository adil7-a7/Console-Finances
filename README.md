## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PROGRAM FOR A COMPANY

## Overview

In this week's challenge as part of the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp we have to analyse data for the Financial Statement.
We have a dataset composed of arrays with 2 fields, Date and Profits/Losses.

## User Story
This Program processes mathematical operations of years in miliseconds in order to know if the company is in PROFIT or LOSS for the period provided within the dataset.


## User Acceptance Criteria

1. The Program should display the following calculations in the console:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
